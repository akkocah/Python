You can find also interview question solution also. I try to put explanation of questions such as;

- QUESTION:
- This is an interview question asked by Facebook.
- Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
- For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
- You can assume that the messages are decodable.
- For example, '001' is not allowed.
